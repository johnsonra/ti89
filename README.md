# Ti 89 functions

This repo contains some statistics functions for my old Ti 89 (nearly 20 years old). I think the new ones might have some of this functionality built in.

This is an approixmation of the gamma function as defined [here](http://www.rskey.org/CMS/8-programmable-calculators?start=268). I made a few small edits and left a couple of lines out (e.g. I'm not going to use this for imaginary numbers). There is another option [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_approximation#Simple_implementation) that might result in higher accuracy.
